# Solution Boilerplate

As mentioned in the problem statement, feel free to use your own development tools and stack
as long as your solution is implemented in Python.

This boilerplate requires a Unix-like environment. For Windows users, this should work with
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

To get started, install the following:
  - [Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3.12/)
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
  - [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

  # to install dependencies using poetry
  - [Make install] (poetry install)
  # to start application
  - [Make run](uvicorn app:app --reload)
  # to tun test cases
  - [Make test] (pytest tests/test_app.py)
